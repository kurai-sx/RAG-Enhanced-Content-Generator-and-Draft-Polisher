2091,"Give back to the world, donate groceries for the upliftment of mentally challenged children",Children,https://www.donatekart.com/Children/donate-grocery," Sunil Satpute, though not challenged, was born in extreme poverty. With an alcoholic father, and a mother who worked in domestic help to support her kids, huts and open sewage pipes was a norm for Sunil. But it was up to him to prove himself, with a college degree and joined an NGO to work towards the education of street children. He then took up social work full time. Determined that no child goes through the same, Sunil decided to give back to the world. He learned that the state of the education and living conditions of the mentally and physically challenged is quite disheartening. Most of them are a burden and a disappointment to their parents. With their potential wasting away, they grow up without the essential help to develop skills as not many agee to invest time and money, especially for the autistic and mentally incapable. Sunil then took it upon himself to provide the necessary care and treatment these challenged children require, and he was successful in his mission. Sunil Satpute founded Gharkul to take care of the educational and vocational needs of differently-abled children from Mumbai’s slums, who would otherwise spend their lives within the four walls of their homes. Gharkul is based in Santacruz. With a special curriculum, and vocation, special needs, and requirements, classrooms are rented to provide lessons to children with down's syndrome, learning difficulties, and special needs. But as Gharkul grew, people became aware, more and more children started coming in. Funding was running out, and additional staff was required to take care of the home. Therapists, special educators, clinical psychologists and more need to be hired. With proper help and care, these children and young adults can acquire skills and make something of themselves. Groceries and meals are a big part of Gharkul and due to insufficient funding, there's not enough for everyone. They need proper nutrition along with education to grow mentally and physically. Won't you lend a hand?Donate groceries, help challenged children grow up with the necessary education and help.

2095,"Help the elderly age with grace, donate adult diapers",Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/adult-diaper," Most of us are very fond of our grandparents. Once young, they are now old and grey but full of wisdom. They need assistance with routine work, and we help them because they're family. But some elderly don't age with assistance. In old age, when your body doesn't support you anymore, it's difficult to do everyday tasks. Going to the bathroom can be a challenge for some. And while everyone deserves to age with grace, some of these elderly have to deal with embarrassment on a daily basis. They defecate in their undergarments or pass urine in their sleep. It's needless suffering and shame they have to deal with. These senior citizens raised us, they did their part, they should be resting and enjoying this time. With your help, these senior citizens can get their independence back. They can spend their final days with dignity. Donate an adult diaper, help the elderly live their last years with pride and peace.Beneficiary NGOs: Om Ashram Trust(Bangalore): Omashram Trust-Old Age Care, is a charitable trust founded in the year 2001 with the objective of providing care to the elderly.

2132,"Donate a walking stick, donate vision to a visually challenged person ",Specially-Abled,https://www.donatekart.com/Specially-Abled/walking-stick," What is your worst nightmare? An injury? A fall? Complete darkness? Ever been to a place so dark you can't make out anything? For some people, it's reality. Each one of us has tried to imagine what it's like to be visually challenged. But we can never come close to it. To eliminate color, sights, written characters, or any visual from our lives, would be devastating. But for some, it isn't a choice. A congenital disability, an accident, has left them visually challenged for life. Every routine task, every step a visually challenged person takes, is a struggle. They could trip, run into a vehicle, or gravely injure themselves. A visually challenged person is dependent on someone to show them the way, which leaves them feeling like a burden on their loved ones.A simple walking stick is a boon for the visually challenged. It can guide them, make them aware of steps, or any obstacle in the way. A commodity like this one is sometimes not readily available for them. It's either not sold where some visually challenged folks live or too expensive. Which is an unfair reason for them to suffer. Life has been cruel enough, taking away their sight. Help be their eyes, donate a walking stick. A visually challenged person will be grateful for your donation, and be able to go on with his/her life. Beneficiary NGO:1.

2136,"Help Dr. Uday Modi build a nursing home for the elderly, donate construction material.",Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/Help-Modi," All of us love our grandparents. We love spending time with them; grandma makes us yummy food, and grandpa tells us stories of his time. They're old and full of wisdom to share with their families. But unfortunately, many elderly don't have families to rely on. They don't have money to buy food, nobody to take care of them. Since, in this age, it's difficult to hold a job, sources of revenues are scarce. With old age comes health complications. During a time where they need love, care, and nutrition, they face hunger, health problems, and worse. Should they go on living like this? They've done their time for the nation, for their families, it's their turn to live their final years peacefully. But sadly, they're left helpless. A doctor, saving lives every day, saw the horrific situation of some of these elderly and decided to change things for the better. Dr. Uday Modi noticed their living conditions and decided to start providing meals to needy elderly. After receiving an overwhelming response, the meals grew to tiffin services, especially for the diabetic. Today, he feeds about 500 elderly daily. Even with help from friends, volunteers, and more, the bills stack up to lakhs a month. But this will not stop him, except it only motivated him to do more. The next step in his plan is to build a nursing home. A reliable and convenient solution to provide care and nutrition to these poor grandparents. Here, they'll receive proper square meals, attention from medical staff, and will be surrounded by people to socialize and spend their days with ease. But this will need a lot of funds and a lot of construction material. We urge you to help the needy elderly, who've spent their years for us and would appreciate a helping hand in return. Donate construction material and help Dr. Uday Modi build a nursing home. Beneficiary NGO:1. Sharavan Tiffin Service - The tiffin service started by Mr. Uday Modi, named ‘Sharavan Tiffin Seva’ started small, over a decade ago. He named it after Sharavan Kumar, a figure in Hindu mythology, known for his undying devotion to his parents. Through this service, today he feeds over 500 senior citizens. Now, he is building an old-age home for these elderly people where they can live out the rest of their days in peace.Where is it located?Maa bap nu Mandir. Near : sant Anthony's chepal margali talav.

2181,Join Jasper Paul On His Journey To Give Them A Second Chance!,Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/TSCT-CoronRelief,"Second chances, you don’t get them that often. And, if you did, trust me you’re blessed. Jasper Paul, at the age of nineteen, was a victim of a near-fatal crash. In the crash, his car somersaulted thrice but miraculously Jasper came out without a scratch. This miraculous escape inspired Jasper to do something of his life. Two months down Jasper saw a woman near a railway station. She had many injuries and they were covered in maggots and ants. He couldn’t leave without doing anything. He immediately admitted her into a hospital. The video went viral and the parents of the old woman came to take her back home.“It was then that I realized that there is nothing else that I’d want to do in life than this.”, says Jasper Paul. He saw the plight of the abandoned and the ones who despite their vulnerable age were left on the road to suffer. Jasper Paul formed The Second Chance Trust for all those who left in horrendous conditions. Old people who were left without food and without anyone to care for them on the road. During the course of his work, 23-year-old Jasper has seen several deaths. Even though they’re nearing death, Jasper ensures that they’re taken care of in their home. “Many of them have died in my arms, and for many, I have conducted their last rites too,”says Jasper PaulJasper and his team were once transporting a lady in her last stages to hospital and because it was a personal vehicle without a siren. Unfortunately, she passed away before the vehicle reached the hospital. If they had an ambulance, Jasper could’ve rescued more people and maybe save more lives. After working with several NGOs across the city, Jasper set up his own shelter home, ‘Second Chance’, in March 2017. Jasper has around 12 staff working with him, including a nurse and other trained non-clinical staff.Jasper brought the dying, the destitute, the needy, the sick and the ones that nobody wanted to the home. At Second Chance, these people who nobody ever cared for were given love, food, clothing, medication, safety, comfort and a place that they could call their own. These rescues and the emergency hospital runs requires an ambulance. Jasper rescues people who’re dying and for them each second counts. An ambulance can help them save them and give them a better treatment. If they have an ambulance, they can have basic facilities like oxygen, a first aid kit and a stretcher to easily rescue the abandoned. As part of their project ‘Be A Blessing’, they provide food supplies and basic health care to the poor and the vulnerable living in the remote and tribal areas, the areas that are unreached. There are many inmates in Second Chance’s old age homes. Jasper has been striving to provide a better life for them for the last 6 years. He needs your help to provide them with basic necessities like mattresses, pillows, etc.“Love is the greatest of them all” is a saying they all believe in at The Second Chance homes. It takes an amazing amount of courage to go out there and bring change. Help Jasper on his journey to give the dying a second chance. Together, we can give them hope.

2195,Help us feed stray animals post COVID - 19,Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Help-Animal,"The Corona virus has locked people inside their homes, caused the death of thousands of individuals and is now hurting animals. These furry four-legged creatures are suffering as the lockdown has left them wandering on the streets for food. Since the Janta Curfew, many animals have been starving for days. Hundreds of them scouting for tidbits of food here and there. Stray animals are seen wandering around the streets of India. They’re reliant on the scraps given by the public such as passersby, restaurants, and so on. Amidst the lockdown, hundreds of cafes, restaurants, bakeries, shops, and establishments have been shut down. These stays already live in horrendous conditions and the lockdown is starving them to death. The strays often relied on people who’ve kindly left out water in bowls. Without any source of food and water, these animals are suffering. After a directive issued by Maneka Gandhi that the stray animals can be fed. AMTM has made a strategic plan to feed the animals. Our NGO,Animals Matter To Me (AMTM) have decided to start supplying dog and cat food to animals across Mumbai. We made four teams, many strays have not got any food for nearly 48 hours. Ganesh Nayak, Founder of AMTMDue to the risk of Corona, AMTM will be taking several precautions to execute the drive. They plan on making four AMTM teams for the Mumbai region. To avoid the risk of getting infected, they’ll conduct midnight operations. The staff and volunteers will hire 4 to 8 ambulances to conduct the drive. They’ll also conduct food, water and healthcare checks. Keeping the safety of the staff and volunteers in mind, AMTM will be responsibly conducting the drive at wee hours. Corona virus can be fatal if the stray animals aren’t fed as it can raise several issues that can elevate the problem. AMTM will be operating on alternative days to cover all the respective regions in Mumbai to ensure that all the stray animals get food. For the animals, they’re looking for dog food, cat food, food bowls and water bowls. They are looking for donations to provide the volunteers and employees with face masks, sanitizers, and first aid kits. This initiative is to protect the volunteers who’re going out of their way to help feed these stray animals. You can help feed many stray animals from the comfort of your own home. Help feed these animals so they can withstand the crisis until things go back to normal. Together, we can do it. With Covid19 lashing it out at us in and out with out much support. Our work for the inhouse cases continue like before. Cases of cruelty keep going up and we are battling for support. With covid19 many losing losing their jobs or businesses going down number of donors have decreased too. With your support we are able to feed approx 285 plus animals on daily basis which are our in-house rescues and feeding of strays continues on streets of marwe.

2350,Help Laxmi Narayan Tripathi On Her Journey To Build A Better World.,Transgender,https://www.donatekart.com/Transgender/Help-Kineer,"The Corona virus pandemic, and consequent lockdowns around the world have changed the fabric of our lives in diverse ways, and we are seeing these narratives in the communities, especially the Transgender community. Amidst the lockdown, the transgender community has been facing battles of survival on various fronts. With postponements and cancellations of various weddings, ceremonies and a ban on public gathers has hit this community hard. The common population at least has families to support them and to be with them in these tough times. But, for the transgender community, they’re shunted and humiliated on various occasions. India’s transgender community suffers amid the crisis more than anyone else because of lack of social acceptance. Shelter, food, money, access to information and basic safety measures though may seem essential but are not within the reach of all citizens, especially for the transgender community. Like a light at the end of a tunnel, Laxmi Narayan Tripathi emerged as an activitist and worked towards making lives better for the Transgender community. This community is not only marginalized and vulnerable but they’re also stigmatized. The only support and shelter they have are one another. Additionally they are concerned about practical issues such as not having a ration card, and other documents. There is panic and fear around not being able to avail government schemes. “Transgender community do not have the social honor of operating within a distant ‘online’ world when their lives are precariously balanced on the thread of social interaction and functions,” said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, a transgender rights activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, the first transgender person to represent Asia Pacific in the UN in 2008 faced several challenges in her journey. Laxmi has done some tremendously great work for the LGBT community. Born into an orthodox Brahmin family, being a transgender could’ve been the worst thing that could’ve happened to her. But, she bore all the stigma and the insults the world could throw and grew into an amazing person. She has supported the transgender community through various social campaigns and has become the most influential transgender activist in the country. She works with numerous NGOs, including the Astitva Trust, the Asia Pacific Transgender Network and Maharashtra Trithiya Panthi Sangatana, to promote the equality of transgender individuals. She is the subject of two books, Me Hijra, Me Laxmi (written by R. Raj Rao) and Red Lipstick: The Men in My Life (written by Pooja Pande).The plight of the Transgender community is not hidden from anyone but still no action has been taken towards providing a sustainable employment/ income source for them. They are left with a choice to either beg on the roads or to indulge in flesh trade. Laxmi, through her initiative Kineer Services aims to provide employment opportunities, education, consultation and help to this vulnerable community. Today, as she has been for the larger part of her life, she’s fighting to provide for the transgender community. She’s striving to provide quality food so that this neglected community can survive the crisis. As we all stay at our homes, hoping for the crisis to pass. Let’s give back to the ones who are neglected, the ones who are not accepted and to the ones who’ve been hit the hardest. Your contribution is not a donation, it’s an investment. An investment in making the lives of the transgenders better. An investment in helping the vulnerable survive. Invest now, to support this vulnerable community. About Kineer Services pvt Ltd. - We at Kineer believe that our community has gaps where the Hijras can fit perfectly. For example at India it is considered unsafe for a girl/ lady to travel by a cab/taxi alone. Our question is why the cabs of the leading taxi service companies can’t be operated by the members of the third gender. This would not only eradicate the concern of safety for women travellers but would also provide a dignified employment opportunity for the Hijra.The following initiatives are run by Kineer -Kineer Packaged drinking water plants;Kineer Cosmetics and washroom amenities range;Kineer Education platform;Kineer National Cricket league;Kineer manpower Placement and Diversity inclusion platformNote: Donations towards this fundraiser are not eligible for any tax deduction such as 80G, 501(c) etc."
2378,Join DAVO On A Remarkable Journey To Give The Elderly and the Homeless A Healthier Life!,Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/Feed-Destitute-Elderly," Even the smallest act of kindness can bring an enormous wave of change. It’s quite unfortunate that not many of us recognize the difference we can make in making this world a better place, unless something moves us from within. This is exactly what happened with Dev Goswami. He was born in a modest family in a village in Haryana. Like many other children at that time, Dev also worked in his school days to support his poor family. He worked hard to bring in Rs. 50-60 per month. An 18-year-old Dev was stuck at a railway station without any money or food. He hadn't eaten anything for over 2 days. Helpless Dev walked over to a stall and asked the person for a puri. Unable to fill his stomach, he reached his hand out for one more, but the vendor at the stall scolded Dev and sent him away. This experience hurt Dev to such an extent that he decided on that day that he’ll feed as many hungry people as he can. During his time as a truck driver in 1978, he was deeply disturbed by the heartwrenching sights of the homeless, hungry, elderly, and the destitute on the roads of India. Each sight reminded him of the times when he stretched his hand out for a meal and was left in the lurch. He started by feeding the helpless and the hungry on the roads. Bit by bit, he started providing them with a bath and a haircut. He stopped working as a truck driver and devoted himself to helping others. Fortunately, his wife Tara was inspired by Dev’s efforts and joined him on his remarkable journey.Dev and his wife Tara have been helping the homeless, elderly, and the destitute from the last 35 years. Since 1984, they have been working relentlessly for their welfare. They have carried out this service of helping the homeless, caring for them, and providing them food. Now, they have two homes for the homeless in Dwarka and Delhi with over 60 inmates. Of the 60 inmates, who live in a 1,800 square foot area, 20 are mentally challenged, and eight are differently-abled. They also have one in Sonipat that houses 160 inmates. While Tara takes responsibility for the Delhi home, Dev looks after the Sonipat home. Today, in these unprecedented times, there is a huge need for the work Dev and Tara have been doing. However, running these old age homes can be extremely challenging. They need your help to provide the elderly, homeless, and the destitute they've rescued. With the Corona outbreak at large in the country, it’s essential for the elderly and the homeless to be able to have a healthy life. For this, they need nutritious food, sanitary supplies, and proper hygiene. “Our donors have stopped giving us things. Earlier, we would tell them what we needed. Now, they are afraid to come to the ashram,"" Dev says, adding that they fear the police and the transmission of the coronavirus. Dev and Tara are struggling with the expenses of the inmates. Your support will help Dev and Tara provide nutritious meals to the homeless and the elderly. We urge you to come forward and give as much as you can. With you on their side, they can reach out and help more people find a place to call home.Note: Donations made towards this fundraiser in INR on and after 29th September 2020are eligible for Indian Tax Exemption."
2432,Help Voice of Slums Give These Vulnerable Children a Better Life,Children,https://www.donatekart.com/Children/Help-VoS-Children," India is home to the largest population of slum children in the world. Today, they are suffering.These children from the slums don’t have proper food. They are often found picking rags, stealing, eating leftovers, and struggling to survive. They are malnourished and have severely weakened immune systems. They come from homes where parents can only feed them once a day on the days they get any work. Some of these children don’t have parents and they often starve themselves. Even though the lockdown has ended, several daily wage labourers have no work. They live in deplorable conditions and have been struggling to feed their children for months now. Many of these children don’t have food. They often resort to eating leftovers and whatever little they can find. Voice of Slum was the ray of hope for these vulnerable children in these slums. Chandni Khan, an ordinary girl who grew up in the slums of Mumbai. With her father’s untimely death, she resorted to picking up rags. It was when she turned 18, she realized that many NGOs only work with children until they reach 18 years of age. Like her, Dev was another child from the slum looking to change his life. He also joined Chandni when he was moved by his mother’s demise, and they together formed Voice of Slum. Chandni and Dev soldiered on in their efforts to provide street children with basic amenities such as health, education, and shelter. They do all of this with the help of contributors, volunteers, and mentors. Voice of Slums take the children in and give them education for a year. During this time, they prepare the child for formal education. After a year, they enroll the child into a school. They also provide additional tuition classes for the children. “Today, we have trained about 300 students.

2442,Donate a Grocery Kit to Help Devdoot Feed The Hungry,Hunger,https://www.donatekart.com/Hunger/Devdoot-grocery," It was two years ago when Pankaj Gupta was passing by a dumpster near his home, he noticed that a few children were picking rotten fruits and vegetables. This incident changed Pankaj’s life entirely. Immediately, Pankaj and his brother, Vipin decided to provide one nutritious meal to the underprivileged and the vulnerable. They arranged for a local cook to cook a meal and it was on 14th April 2018, that they started serving nutritious meals to the needy. Pankaj felt that whoever is eating this food, they have their own dignity and self-respect. They decided to sell each plate of food for as low as Rs. 5. This is a nominal price that anyone can afford. However, during these tough times there are many who cannot put together Rs. 5/-, they are given the meal for free. “We don’t charge a single penny from those who can’t afford such a nominal cost. Food is free for them. we really don’t want such people to stay hungry or eat unhygienic food.”, says Pankaj. In the initial days, they were providing around 100 to 150 people with food. They saw an increasing need to cook more food. What started out with a single cook now turned into a community kitchen. Pankaj started the Devdoot Kitchen with the belief that when they can cook the food, they can use the most nutritious and quality ingredients to cook.Despite various comments and hurdles, they worked with an aim to help another. Later, people started contributing raw ingredients like Rice, Dal, Oil, etc. The lockdown was a painful time for everyone. More and more people turned up for food every day. It was during this time that Pankaj and his team started serving three full meals each day to over 700+ families in Rajiv Nagar, Gurgram. Many people started contributing to this noble cause. While some donated in cash, others donated in kind - but the help never stopped. Today, Pankaj and his team need your help to continue providing nutritious meals to the needy. Even though the lockdown is over, there are hundreds of families who’re out of work and are struggling to survive. Donate a grocery kit to help Devdoot provide nutritious food to the poor.

2450,Donate A Urinary Catheter To Give The Physically Challenged Individuals A Better Life!,Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/Urinary-Catheter-Project," Can you imagine being confined to a bed? Can you imagine not being able to do anything and depending on someone entirely for everything? While this might sound hard for people like us to read, it’s the reality that many challenged people go through each day. Lalith was diagnosed with a rare neuro disorder, Transverse Myelitis at a tender age of 11. In simple terms, Transverse Myelitis means that Lalith’s motor and commanding nerves around the spinal cord were badly affected. This meant he couldn’t move as he could before, and he also lost his bowel &amp; bladder control.At a fragile age where he could be playing with the other children, Lalith was confined to his bed for five long years. It was in 2009, when he started his HR consultancy that he started helping others suffering from spinal cord disabilities. Many of them don't have bowel and bladder control. So, he started his work by giving them urinary catheters and urine bags each costing over Rs 500 for free. He started Love and Acceptance, an NGO that works for people with mobility and spinal cord disabilities on his birthday, June 12, 2014. Love and Acceptance were formed with Lalith’s belief that disability is not a person’s identity. Many of these individuals who are physically challenged have a tough life. They often have to depend on others for their basic needs. It can be embarrassing and emotionally hurt them especially when it’s related to their personal hygiene habits. One of our team members, Akil visited a beneficiary for a testimony along with Lalith. They went down to the lady’s house with a pack of adult diapers and sanitary pads. It was quite late in the evening, and when they were about to leave, Kamala thanked them for coming.She said, ""For you, these might be mere diapers and sanitary pads, but for us, it is life. Life with dignity."" She went on to explain how much it means to her, ""I don't have control over my bowel and bladder system. The worst would happen during my periods. The bed would have stained in blood, and by the time help arrives, I would have pooped too"". On hearing this, Akil’s tongue had gone dry, and his legs started to feel weird. But she wasn't done yet, ""At times I wouldn't be aware of what has happened, and the ants would be all over the place."" A wave of empathy struck him, and his legs refused to move. Akil could also relate to the pain and misery that Kamala faced. It dawned on us that there are thousands of individuals who are suffering from similar incidents. They too, deserve a life filled with dignity. After the Corona pandemic broke out, many of these individuals were struggling to make ends meet. They couldn’t bear the expense of adult diapers and urinary catheters. Love and Acceptance, has been helping thousands of individuals live a better life, a life with dignity. You can help them by donating a urinary catheter and a pack of adult diapers today. It’s not just a diaper or a catheter, for them it’s a way to preserve their dignity. It’s a way to have a better life. About Love and Acceptance - “Love and Acceptance” is for every individual with and without physical challenges in this whole world, A simple initiative with a devoted discipline to serve better for the needy.

2452,"This Radhashtami, help us feed the widows of Vrindavan",Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/Janmashtami-2020," After the Corona pandemic broke out, life isn’t the same anymore. Almost every industry, community, and individual is affected by the nationwide lockdown. Even though the lockdown is over across the country, there are several cities which are still following certain precautions and have certain restrictions in place. Vrindavan, also known as Brindaban, was home to Lord Diety during his childhood days. Even today, millions of devotees of Radha Diety visit places of pilgrimage in the city every year. During the holy occasion of Radhashtami, the streets and temples of Vrindavan echo with bhajans and kirtans. It’s a magnificent sight as thousands of widows perform this ritual with unparalleled devotion. Women, after their spouse’s demise, come down to Vrindavan in their quest to seek spiritual salvation. They spend their life with other widows in the Ashrams.On a normal day, you’d see many widows eke out a living by performing Bhajans and Kirtans. After the nationwide lockdown was imposed, they’ve been left in the lurch without any kind of savings. Many widows here depend on the Ashrams for food, and survival. There are around 6000 widows living in Vrindavan. Today, they don’t have any source of income or work. They hardly have any savings. Without any visitors or pilgrims coming down to Vrindavan, these widows are on the verge of starvation. Radhashtami is a time when thousands of travelers, believers, and pilgrims make their way to Vrindavan for spiritual enlightenment. Unfortunately, this year, hardly anyone can go down to this holy city. “During Corona, there’s no work...the ashram is running out of its resources. We need help.” said Madhabi, an 80-year-old widowed woman in Vrindavan. These widows are vulnerable. They have nobody to depend on. We urge you to come forward and help them. You might not be able to make the journey this Radhashtami, but you can definitely help feed hundreds of widows by donating a grocery kit. Donate a grocery kit.

People across the nation welcome Lord Diety as he arrives on earth with his mother Goddess Parvati. For generations, these murtikars have been making spectacular idols. However, this year the COVID-19 pandemic has not only snatched the grand celebrations away from people but also hit these communities. The Brihanmumbai Ganesh Murtikar Sangh is an umbrella association of over 700 idol makers in Mumbai. The members of the association are now worried about how the pandemic will affect the idol makers and their families. These sculptors make all kinds of idols in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Then, they can feed their families by selling these idols. Making The Difference, a well-renowned Mumbai-based NGO has joined hands with them and will facilitate the distribution of food kits to all the idol makers in need. “Every year I make at least 1000 Ganesh idols but this time I have been able to finish only about 450. Again, not all of them are sold yet. What I’ve earned so far is no match for how much I need to survive the whole year.” said Shambhu, an idol maker living in the outskirts of Mumbai. This year’s low-key Ganpati celebration has affected many families. Livelihood of thousands of poor families are dependent on the Ganesh festival. Many workers come from other cities to help with sculpting or painting the idols.The association is afraid of how this pandemic might affect the members of the association. They’re worried about how these poor families will survive until next year. Many of these families have been struggling to survive in the last five months without any source of income.

Even though the lockdown was lifted, many of them are still struggling to feed themselves. Mansi Lakshmi is the president of Aarju Foundation, a community based organization in Mumbai that works with the issues that the Transgender community face. “We, kinners, can request others to help us with food. People show us a little kindness sometimes, but it’s not like that for the s*x workers”, said Mansi.These women do not have the privilege to stock up their cupboards with food. They are at the receiving end of a lot of harassment and hate. Coming from very poor families and with no formal education, they have had to find a way to make a living. A lot of them were also forced into this line of work, they have had no choice. The transgender community knows what is feels like to be marginalized, to be mocked, ridiculed and even feared. This is the reason why Mansi and her organization now stands in solidarity with them. Women here have been unable to put food on the table for the past few weeks, many of them are young mothers.

2461,"Together, Let’s Care For These Injured Strays",Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Help-Charlies," It’s not every day that we hear a miracle rescue story. However, at Charlie’s or better known as CARE, there are thousands of animals who find their forever home. These animals were mostly abandoned, abused, injured, or just lost.Ms Sudha Naryan is the Founder Trustee of CARE (Charlie’s Animal Rescue Care Center). She’s helped over 50,000 animals in the last 30 years. Among those 50,000 precious animals, Honeybun was one of the rescued strays. Honeybun was found on the streets with a deep gash on the side. She was an obese labrador, and it looked like she was walking for a very long time. She might have been abandoned by her caretakers during the pandemic outbreak. They brought her to CARE and took care of her. She had a weak blood profile, but slowly she fought and regained her health. Today, Honeybun lives a happy life at CARE. It is known as the best trauma care centre in Bangalore. They’ve been helping thousands of injured animals recover from life-threatening conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the number of strays on the roads. Many dogs were abandoned and those who were already living on the streets had no idea what was going on. They noticed that their human friends who visited them were no longer around. With nobody to feed or take care of them, many were left to fend for themselves. The animals that are most often brought into CARE OPD are in terrible shape. They suffer from prolonged neglect and are battling between life and death. Many of these animals also suffer from extremely low platelet counts, low haemoglobin counts and other essential parameters. For a successful recovery, they also need proper nutrition and diet. The team at CARE work relentlessly to take care of these stray animals. They have a dedicated helpline, a professional veterinarian, and 3 ambulances. However, the need for help is now more than ever. The ambulances are also on their last leg. These ambulances have roamed hundreds and thousands of kilometres. Ever since the nationwide lockdown was announced, the team at CARE have scaled their rescues, they get calls from various parts of Bangalore and even the outskirts to rescue animals.Sometimes, they aren’t able to reach a location on time. This can mean the difference between life and death for an animal in a desperate condition. With so many animals in need of help, they need your support and generosity. You can help them by donating towards critical life-supporting medicines and an ambulance. Taking care of these injured dogs around, and helping them regain their full health is no less than a miracle. We urge you to be a part of this miraculous journey and to help thousands of animals looking for their forever home. They’re not just strays, they’re precious beings trying to find their forever home. Together, we can give them a better life. Together, we can give them hope.

2471,"It’s our turn to deliver food to the Mumbai Dabbawalas, together.",Hunger,https://www.donatekart.com/Hunger/Help-Mumbai-Dabbawala," Mumbai has a beautiful spirit - no matter what, you’ll end up falling in love with it. The Dabbawalas carry the same resilient and tough spirit wherever they go. Back in 2005, when Mumbai was battered by unusually heavy monsoon rains. More than 25 inches of rain combined with record-high tides, wreaked widespread havoc, bringing everything to a virtual standstill. There were hundreds of people stranded in railway stations, trains and even on the sidewalks. Among them were many of Mumbai’s dabbawalas, who deliver meals prepared in customers’ homes to their offices. On the second day of the flooding, even before the city had limped back to life, the dabbawalas were back on the job, wading through the waist-high water. They quickly became a symbol of gritty resilience. Their 130-year heritage combined with their tough spirit and dedication became an epitome of Mumbai’s spirit across the world. Today, these dabbawalas form the world’s most efficient logistics supply chain. These men, even though they don’t have a strong educational background, they created a system that relies on colour codes, symbols and signs. These dabbawalas took full control of delivering the lunch box or better known as the Dabba to the right person at the fixed lunch hour without any IT infrastructure or mobile phones. Their system of delivery is so robust and strong that it’s included as a case study as part of many business school’s management studies curriculum. A Dabba travels through six dabbawalas before it reaches the destination. It also travels through the same number of men on its return journey as well. It’s almost an understatement to say that these men are a lifeline for Mumbaikars. If you have ever travelled through the Mumbai locals, you’re bound to come across men dressed in white uniforms carrying a large tray filled with lunch boxes. For the first time in over 130 years, the dabbawalas were unable to deliver. This cooperative business that the dabbawalas have formed gives them job security. Irrespective of their role, each person earns around Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 12,000 per month. Many of them come from the slums and don’t have a lot of savings. Six months ago when the pandemic broke out, it wreaked havoc on their livelihood. With offices, industries, banks, and most establishments being closed during the last six months. ""Today, we are going through a crisis, our 130 years of history is at stake. Five thousand dabbawalas are going through a crisis. Please help us, we need help,"" said Dabbawala Enterprises Limited President Sandeep S Gaikar. Men who fought through floods, rains, bombings, and even cyclones are now deprived of their livelihood because of COVID-19. The pandemic threw life out of motion and left more than 5,000 dabbawalas out of work. Even though the lockdown is over, there are many industries who have employees working from home. Without the local trains operating, it’s another hurdle for these men to continue their work. These men have ensured that our lunch is delivered every day on time, rain or shine. Today, it’s our turn to help them feed their families.Donate a grocery kit to help the dabbawalas. Beneficiary NGO:1.

2473,Help Animal Shelter Noida build a safe haven for abandoned and injured animals,Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Help-AnimalShelter," Every animal deserves a peaceful life, as much as we do. Docile creatures like dogs, cows, donkeys, cats, birds, etc. are meant to roam freely with the assurance of complete safety. However, that is often not the case. These innocent animals aren’t always treated well. Sometimes they are abandoned for having aged. The ailing ones are shooed away. They end up succumbing to their sickness. Those that meet with an accident on the roads are left to die. The strays suffer from extreme starvation and thirst. Yet, nobody cares to extend help.Life for these animals is extremely tough. Unlike us, they cannot voice their pain and needs. The Animal Hospital and Shelter team, based in Noida, works round the clock to rescue such animals. It is the largest animal shelter in NCR spread across 9 acres of land that’s home to over 1500+ animals. Injured, aged, ailing, and abandoned animals are rescued and brought to the shelter for a better life. Daily, they rescue and treat over 50 animals with the help of 3 ambulances.Like every other shelter, this one too runs on donations. Because of the pandemic though, none of the donors are coming out to volunteer or help.These rescued animals have begun to suffer due to the present situation as well. The shelter still requires a lot of constructional improvement. Some of the sheds have started to crumble. They are dripping rainwater. The injured, paralyzed animals living under them cannot move about to save themselves. The Animal Hospital and Shelter team wants to repair the sheds and expand the area to make more space. But without enough donations, that seems unlikely to them. They need construction material to repair their battered and damaged sheds, to give these animals a better home.The shelter is trying their best to handle the situation and protect the animals. But even so, they need your support. After being rescued, these animals were given a second chance at life. You can help give these strays a better home. The construction materials that you donate will not only strengthen the roof over their heads, but restore their hope as well. “One doesn’t have to be wealthy to give for them, they should only be rich in heart.”, Anuradha Dogra, an animal activist from the Animal Hospital and Shelter team, declares hopefully. Let’s not let them down. Together we can stand by them and empower their mission of giving animals a better life. Come, let us ensure that.About Animal Hospital and Shelter - Animal Hospital and Shelter is located in Sector 94 Noida.

However, now, we see more bulls wandering on the roads with nobody to feed or take care of them. When bulls get old, they’re abandoned by their owners. While some are sent off to the slaughterhouses, others are thrown on the road. A cow in its lifetime can feed 4,10,440 people once a day while its meat is sufficient only for 80 people. Killing a bull is equivalent to killing a cow. Shree Nandishala is a Gaushala that’s different from other Gaushalas.

Shree Nandishala rescues them to give them a place to call home. They have over 100 employees who constantly strive to provide a better life for these bulls.

Shree Nandishala is the only place where they provide an ICU for animals in a radius of 100km.

2506,Help This Humble Cabbie Build A School For Poor Children,Children,https://www.donatekart.com/Children/Gazi-construction," Deep in the Sundarbans, a quiet change is brewing. Children here often come from underprivileged families with next to no access to schooling. This is slowly changing thanks to the efforts of a compassionate cabbie from Kolkata named Jalaluddin Gazi, who is working tirelessly to build a new school for children in the Sundarbans. Mr Gazi has faced numerous hardships in his own life and he’s committed to ensuring that future generations won’t have to struggle the way he did. Mr Gazi endured the pain of not being able to follow his dreams and continue his education due to financial struggles, and now he wants to make sure that other children from poor families don’t have to face this. He has started 3 schools with the help of benevolent donors and his own hard work.He started his first school in a small room in his own house. He continuously reminds the people around him about the importance of education and the importance of sending their children to school. Eventually, he started teaching driving classes as well. He caught over 400 people for free, only asking for their help to build a school.Mr Gazi’s schools are free of charge and open to all. He only asks ex-students to donate a mere rs. 5 every month when they start working. All he wants is to educate children and give them a better future. Every child has a right to education and Mr Gazi is on a mission to ensure this right to every child.Mr Gazi has seen the demand for education rise and now he’s set forth to build another school to help underprivileged children. He cannot do this alone and is in dire need of your help. Help this humble man build a school by donating construction material. Every brick, every bag of concrete, it all contributes to making our future a brighter place.

2513,Please donate food products to children of Sphoorti,Children,https://www.donatekart.com/Children/Sphoorti-DU,"The campaign aims to procure some of the edible commodities as part of the Sphoorti Food Program.Sphoorti now houses 200+ kids with the recent addition of 70 kids in the age group of 5-7 years. Your support will help us provide for these children.In addition to academics, we also encourage our children to take up outdoor activities like games and physical activities as well as arts like Drawing, Music and Dance. Your support will help us enrich and empower children in need and distress and help them pursue their life goals with confidence. Sphoorti Children’s Home Project :Most children before coming to Sphoorti were in government schools (Telugu Medium).The state of government schools is pathetic. Students are promoted to higher classes purely based on their attendance and not necessarily on the basis of their performance in examinations. Some of our kids used to work on fields during the harvest season and skipped classes for the better part of the academic year. Our immediate challenge is to make the kids oriented towards studies and make them understand the importance of education in building their careers and lives.Ever since we started taking comprehensive care of these children, we have been pursuing one single goal – make them good citizens of the nation. Accordingly, all the basic needs are being met on par with other children who have a proper family backing. We provide them good food, clothing and recreation facilities.Some of our visitors and donors spend good time with the children and teach them skills like Dance, Painting, Tennis and Music. Many children are doing well in academics and co-curricular programs. They have been participating in cultural and sports events in school, and also in corporate events. In recent times, children have performed dances in different schools, colleges and cultural events in Hyderabad.Most of the children do not have a good grounding in English, Hindi and Social Sciences.We are also trying hard to make our children speak in English to gain fluency. This will give them lot of confidence while interacting with people inside and outside the school.We have an after school support system. We have hired tutors who spend time in the evenings with the children helping them with home assignments and clarifying any questions kids might have in their lessons. There is also an in-house mentoring system - elder children act as guides for younger children and new inmates. These mentors train the kids on habits and procedures followed in Sphoorti.Note: All the donations towards this campaign is eligible for Indian Tax Exemption."
2515,Help build a home for abandoned cows,Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Help-Hingonia," Many of us have a place to call home, where we can get shelter, food, and clean water. However, there are millions of animals that are wandering on the roads, with no place to call home. They have to eat from garbage piles, drink from muddy puddles, and end up getting injured in road accidents. There have been thousands of deaths across the country that involved cattle. These road accidents didn’t only take the lives of humans but have also injured voiceless creatures. Hingonia Gaushala is the world’s largest cow rehabilitation centre that’s spread across 800 acres of land. They provide a home to over 15,000 cattle. Every day, they rescue cows that are injured or abandoned on the roads. These cows are brought to the Gaushala where they can eat proper food, drink clean water, and get proper medical treatment. The cows are fed a mixture of fresh fodder, jaggery, oats, mineral mixture, and salt. This feed is not only healthy but it gives them all-round nutrition. “There are some heart wrenching incidents where these voiceless creatures are hurt beyond damage. There was a cow that was attacked by acid. Our team of doctors worked day and night to help the cow recover.”, said Radha Priya Dasa, secretary of Sri Diety Balram Seva Trust. Hingonia Gaushala takes care of these cows like they would a little child. They have a team of 17 doctors, 30 veterinary compounders, and a team of 70-80 medical professionals who provide treatment to these injured and rescued cows. However, today, their ICU has just the basic facilities. They’re struggling to treat these animals and give them a better life with these battered sheds. They are hoping to construct a new cow shed with a brick floor. that can house many more reduced animals. “We drink our mother’s milk for one or two years of age. However, for the rest of our life, we depend on cow’s milk.”We often hear that a cow is like our mother. Today, the Gau Mata needs a better home. We urge you to contribute generously to give these injured, rescued, and innocent cows a home. About Hingonia Gaushala - In 2016, the Government of Rajasthan and the Jaipur Nagar Nigam decided to partner with Hare Diety Movement Jaipur, which runs the Sri Sri Diety Balaram Mandir at Jagatpura, Jaipur. The full time missionaries of Hare Diety Movement accepted the humble service to mother cows at Hingonia. A special purpose vehicle, Sri Diety Balaram Seva Trust, was set up to run the Hingonia centre with the aid of Jaipur Nagar Nigam. This trust is a non profit organization, dedicated for serving the cattle at Hingonia.Where is it located?Sri Diety Balram Seva Trust, Hingonia Cow Rehabilitation Center, Village – Hingonia, Tehsil - Bassi, District – Jaipur (Rajasthan).Note: All the donations towards this campaign is eligible for Indian Tax Exemption."
2518,"This Durga Puja, help the idol makers of Kolkata",Faith,https://www.donatekart.com/Faith/Help-KumartuliArtisans," The has devastated more lives than we could have imagined. When it had just begun, we heard about the plight of daily wage workers and the migrant labourers who braved a long march back home. But, now as time passes by, many more individuals are struggling to survive. They're fighting with all they have to put food on the table for their children.Kumartuli in Kolkata is widely known for being the clay modellers’ hub. When you take a walk down the lanes of Kumartuli, a sweet smell of clay idols fills your nostrils. It is said that the air of Kumartuli is imbued with the auspiciousness of Maa Durga during this season. Nearly 300 studios stand on the streets of Kumartuli. Over 1000 artisans earn their livelihood by making the Durga idols. Every year they create about 10,000 such idols for various pandals in and around the city. What they earn keeps their families going for the rest of the year.Similarly, hundreds of workers and technicians earn their livelihood in Kolkata by working at the Durga pandals. Some are responsible for decorations, carpentry, etc. and some for lighting and sound. It’s their only way of earning bread and butter during this season. But, this year Durga Puja is entirely different. Because of the Pandemic, the lanes of Kumartuli have seen no visitors for weeks. The idol makers have made no profit whatsoever. Workers and technicians have barely any work. How can they make ends meet like this?Durga Puja is just round the corner. Less than a month is left before the festivities begin. But, owing to the restrictions, celebrations will not be the same this year. People will still be scared to come out and roam freely. Congregations will need to be subdued. This uncertainty has made many organisers step back from the usual grandeur surrounding the festival. They now want a simple 5-day celebration of Maa Durga. Many of them are even opting for digital celebration. This means that the need for theme-based idols and fancy decorations is very less.This has led to mounting helplessness among the idol makers. They can see how much loss they will have to endure this year. Yet, there’s nothing that they can do. All they know is that their families will have to struggle for survival. “I have been working as an idol maker since I was 10, and now more than 50 years have passed. Honestly, I have never seen a time like this before. I don’t know how we will survive.”, said Sushen, an idol maker in Kumartuli. Kumartuli Mritshilpi Association has decided to support the artisans and workers with grocery kits. They believe that during this auspicious time of Durga Puja, no family should sleep on a hungry stomach. But, they need your help to make it possible. Your kindness can ensure happiness for the idol makers during this Durga Puja.Come, let’s stand together to help them get through this difficulty. Let’s show them that we’re in this together.About Kumartuli Mritshilpi Association - Kumartuli Mritshilpi Association was founded in 1950 by renowned artist late Shri Gora Chand Paul. His two sons Mr. Gour Chandra Paul and Gopal Paul have continued his legacy by delivering quality artworks under the name, Gora Chand Paul &amp; Sons.

Girish Kulkarni went through a similar experience in his childhood where he took a little shortcut through a red-light area. As a little Girish wandered through those narrow streets in Ahmednagar, he saw young girls who were his age, involved in the flesh trade. This incident had a profound impact on him. He considered himself lucky for being privileged to be able to go to school, to be able to eat well and to have parents who protected him from all evils that many other children had to endure. When Girish started college, he made many friends, including one who was too embarrassed to invite friends to their home in the red-light area. When they finally did allow Girish to visit, he found out that their 15-year-old sister and mother in her 40s both worked in the red-light area alongside their 70-year-old grandmother. This incident moved Girish to try and help locally in the community instead of joining organizations and shouting slogans of change. His journey of transformation began with him approaching the families in red-light areas asking them what they needed. It started with him taking these children to the park, buying them snacks, telling them stories, and his work soon spread. These simple acts of kindness grew and slowly as the perception of the public towards s*x workers began to shift. ?It was then that Girish founded Snehalaya, a home for children. Today, many children who live in Snehalaya’s Home are also HIV+. “Every woman and child should have the right to a life free from inequality, cruelty and discrimination.”, is something Girish Kulkarni stands by.In these times, these children must have a healthier life. In Snehalaya’s home, they are given medicines, care, nutritious food, and a good life. These children are immunocompromised. They need to have nutrition to protect themselves against this deadly pandemic. Today, Snehalaya works across 22 projects, that over 200,000 individuals have benefited from, saving countless lives and giving dignity back to those marginalised sections of society. Girish, once again proved that small ripples of kindness create a massive wave of change. We urge you to come forward and donate nutritious grocery kits to help these HIV+ children. Donate a grocery kit today. Your small act of kindness can give a child with HIV a better life. About Snehalaya - Snehalaya has been working in rural India for almost three decades to bring rescue, rights and rehabilitation to those adversely affected by the commercial s*x industry, poverty and droughts. We started rescuing trafficked and forced women and children from red light areas in 1989 and have been fighting HIV/AIDS, reducing 2nd generation prostitution by 100% and ensuring there are no minors working in the s*x industry in our district ever since.Note: All the donations towards this campaign is eligible for Indian Tax Exemption."

Sivakasi produces about 70% of the fireworks and matches in India. This huge industry has been the backbone of the local economy that helps support countless families. However, like all explosives, firecrackers are a dangerous thing to manufacture and work with. Accidents are a frequent and often horrific reality. Every year, Sivakasi has at least 10-12 explosions at firework factories. These accidents are devastating. Hundreds of people are left injured and sometimes permanently challenged from these explosions. Some even lose their lives in these tragedies. People affected by these explosions have their entire lives turned upside down. Many are now shunned and isolated by the larger public and they are forced to withdraw from work, gatherings, and social life. The social stigma is debilitating and accident survivors struggle to make it from one day to the next.Survivors often have to live with extensive injuries that continue to cause them pain every day.

Nine years ago, Tarun saw a few children living in the neighbouring slum rummaging through a pile of garbage for food. While this might be a common incident to many others in the country, Tarun was shocked to see the plight of these children.

2689,Help St. Jude India Childcare Centres Give These Children Suffering From Rare Condition A Ray of Hope,Children,https://www.donatekart.com/Children/Cancer-Care," Rare Condition has been around for as many years as we can remember. This dreadful disease is known for causing a lot of distress, pain, and weakness, even during the course of the treatment. Rare Condition can be painful not only for the patient but also for the families. The treatments can be financially and mentally draining. Many families who live in urban areas have some awareness. However, underprivileged families from rural areas have little or no awareness at all. According to the WHO, around 300,000 children aged 0 to 19 years old are diagnosed with rare condition each year. Among this large chunk of children, many of them come from disadvantaged families that cannot afford the treatment. Parents who come from rural areas of India often have no other option but to come to the city for treatment. These families are often employed in the unorganized sector and can barely afford proper food. It’s for these families and many others, that St. Jude India Childcare Centres brought a ray of light. St. Jude India Childcare Centres runs homes and shelters in 9 major cities across India where they help over 400 families with children undergoing rare condition treatment.Since 2006, St. Jude India Childcare Centres has impacted the lives of over 20,000+ children with rare condition.

2711,Feed Abandoned Cows At Dabar Hare Diety Gaushala,Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Help-Dabar," Thousands of cows are abandoned each year by their owners when they no longer have use for them. This practice has led to a constant problem across the country where abandoned cattle are found on the roads. This is dangerous to both the cows and to humans- stray cattle can cause accidents and these poor cows struggle to survive on the streets.Cows are docile and gentle creatures. They aren’t meant to live on the streets, foraging for food, and always on alert for dangers. Over the last year, the pandemic has caused an increase in the number of abandoned cattle. This has happened since many farmers and cowherds have faced tremendous financial difficulties and if they are unable to care for and feed their cows, they feel like the only option left is to abandon their animals.These abandoned cows need our help. Their plight has only worsened during the pandemic. The lack of people means a lot of the cows have nothing to scavenge and are starving. Dabar Hare Diety Gaushala is a safe haven for these abandoned cattle. At present, approximately 7000 cows are housed in this Gaushala. They provide shelter and food to these malnourished and vulnerable animals. The gaushala is a vast sanctuary with 10 lenter and tukdi sheds along with a water tank for each shed and one pond. The cows are also provided with medical care to ensure their good health. The gaushala is situated around Delhi and produces invaluable manure, compost, and gobar that is supplied to those in need. The gaushala organises awareness camps and training sessions.During the lockdown, the gaushala has been struggling to provide food for the cows. The usual donations have become scarce and every day is a struggle. We cannot allow this misfortune to continue. Help Dabar Hare Diety Gaushala feed 5000-6000 cows by donating fodder.

Instead of playing with their friends, they are confined to hospitals and rounds of exhausting treatments.

Many of them are just aged, injured, or abandoned. Many of the cows are also rescued by Gaushalas from slaughterhouses. These cows are docile creatures who often don’t mean any harm at all. However, once they grow old, their owners disown them because they have no use for them. According to the Livestock Census, 2019, India is home to more than 19.34 million stray cattle. For millions of stray cattle and innocent cows, Gaushalas are a place they can call home. Shri Krishanyan Gaushala is home to more than 9000 cows and cattle that live a happy life. Many of these cows have been brought into the Gaushala from horrible times. Some of them are injured, challenged, and are even fighting for their life. Shri Dietyyan Gaushala started their humble work back in 2010 with only 11 cows. Today, they provide a safe haven to over 9000+ cows. They haven’t just given these cows a second home, but also a second chance at life. Many of these cows in the Gaushala are now milk barren, however, they’re taken good care of. They’re fed a good mixture of fodder that includes Wheat, Green Grass, Dried Grass, and Jaggery. They’re given plenty of water and also have acres of land to move around on. They are also looked after by an expert team of doctors in the Gaushala and are treated with good quality medicines. Amid these difficult times, Shri Dietyyan Gaushala is struggling to feed and take care of these precious animals. They also need help with construction materials to build the sheds for the cows so that they can have a safe home. More and more abandoned cows are in need of help - they need someone to look after them. With your help, Shri Dietyyan Gaushala will be able to expand its premises and bring in more and more animals in need.

2726,Help This Angel For Animals Save Our Four-Legged Friends,Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Help-MinuSingh," We’ve all been welcomed by wagging tails and eager eyes outside our homes, hoping for a bite of food or even just some love. All these dogs want is some love and care. But most of them go hungry for days, are abused, and are shown no mercy. India has about 35 million stray dogs wandering the streets every day. That’s millions of dogs without a home struggling to find even a single biscuit to eat. Minu Singh, an animal lover and rescuer based in Bengaluru, strives to change the lives of these lovable strays. Every day, she makes around 25 buckets of food with which she feeds around 900+ dogs in the city as of February 2021. She rides around on her scooter to ensure that every dog she sees is fed and treated, often returns home late at night. Minu has been tirelessly working towards helping dogs and other animals for years now. Minu’s compassion towards animals began at a very young age when she would watch her mother feed a dog named Moti outside their house. She would watch Moti jump on them in excitement and gobble up the food. She was in awe of the change one single meal could bring about. Minu soon began her own rescue missions - whether it was a stray puppy or kitten, an injured bird; they all found a home with Minu as she cared for them until they were better. Word soon spread about Minu’s efforts, and since then, there has been no stopping her. “ In 2010 people saw me feeding over 200 dogs in my area, rescuing them, and even taking them to get treated. Soon, my number became like a helpline for dog rescue! I would get calls from all corners of the city about dogs and other animals that needed help. Before I knew it, I was feeding 700 dogs every single day in the next few years!” Today, Minu has three sheds that she has rented to stock up food for the dogs and to shelter rescued animals. She single-handedly takes care of all these strays. While Minu sometimes receives help from supporters, it is not enough to continue feeding all the dogs in need. With the onset of the pandemic and the nationwide lockdown, Minu faced another challenge. She struggles to find raw food material every day. Because a lot of smaller businesses were shutting down, vendors can’t provide rice and other food materials at an affordable price. On the other hand, she had to increase the number of dogs and area covered from 600 to 800 each day.Minu continues to struggle with these challenges. She just doesn’t have the means to feed the stray dogs anymore. With your help, Minu can feed these voiceless animals and give them the love and care they deserve. About Minu Singh - Minu Singh is an animal activist who feeds over 900 strays per day. She has been actively helping the animals in need, right from neutering, vaccination, feeding to rescuing in and around Bengaluru. Even today, she strives to spread awareness about preventing animal cruelty, feeding and taking care of stray animals.Note: All the donations towards this campaign are eligible for Indian Tax Exemption."

You are entirely dependent on someone else for even the smallest movement, and life as you know it has changed completely. Poorna Rao experienced this three years ago, when an accident in Visakhapatnam left him with a severe spinal cord injury. Completely bedridden, his life came to a standstill. His future job was a distant dream, and he had lost all hope at a young age. However, after two long years, Poorna found hope - one wheelchair gave him a second chance at life. Just like Poorna, there are thousands of people who have benefitted from the efforts of the Association of People with Disability (APD). APD Gives Hundreds Hope And A HomePoorna’s life changed when he came to the Association of People with Disability (APD) in Bangalore, an NGO working towards providing rehabilitation and support to underprivileged people with disabilities. Like him, there are lakhs of people in India with disabilities, struggling to afford proper rehabilitation. At APD, they find hope and a home. Many who’ve come here have been completely dependent on others for their daily activities, but a wheelchair has changed their lives forever.Rick Hansen, an athlete, activist, and philanthropist for people with disabilities, once said, ""The wheelchair should not be a symbol of disability. A wheelchair is a vehicle to liberation and freedom; a chariot for independence.""Until now, APD has given wheelchairs to over 5000 people. Their goal is to ensure that a person with a disability lives the life they had always dreamt of. “After getting a wheelchair, we’ve seen people move around on their own, start playing badminton, and even dance in their wheelchair! It’s given them so much independence, hope, and a better quality of life. We want to continue helping people just like this.” - Venkata Rama Diety Nakkina, CEO, APD However, they’re struggling to provide people with wheelchairs nowFounded in 1959, Association of People with Disability has been changing lives for years now.

2729,"Home To 900 Voiceless Souls, This Shelter In Chennai Is Saving Lives",Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Feed-Them," How many times have we seen a stray puppy scavenging for food near the garbage? Or a lone cat crying out of fear and hunger? There are millions of animals on the streets who have nowhere to go and no one to even offer them a bite of food. Many of them are even abandoned, abused, and left to die. Dr. Shiranee Pereira, the co-founder of People For Animals (PFA) Chennai, rescues stray and abandoned animals like these. She rescues, treats, and rehabilitates animals including dogs, cats, birds, cows, donkeys, and more.Although it started small, PFA Chennai is now home to around 900 animals who live in harmony together, with Dr. Shiranee as the driving force. What makes it even more special is that hers is the only shelter in India that takes in retired police horses. Dr. Shiranee believes that after a lifetime of service, these horses deserve to live a happy retired life.“The past year threw us into huge financial difficulties and challenges that we could not turn our face away from. We took on the onus to send fodder to 143 starving beach horses on Marina and Mahabalipuram beaches. Besides this, we brought home to our shelter the starved, weak and very sick beach horses"" - Dr. Shiranee Pereira, Co-Founder PFA Chennai Today, Dr. Shiranee’s shelter houses around 430 dogs, 140 cats, 24 sheep and goats, 170 cattle, 9 donkeys, 4 pigs, over 50 birds, and 31 horses and ponies. However, like millions of people and animals, the pandemic has gravely affected the PFA Chennai family. For a year now, they have been short of food and funds, struggling to feed the animals. They faced the devastating effects of the cyclone last year, which collapsed their walls and sheds. Despite their difficulties, Dr. Shiranee did her best to continue feeding the 900 animals that rely on her. They even doubled their efforts to rescue stray animals. However, they can’t go on any longer without more help and support. Dr. Shiranee has been single-handedly working tirelessly to give these animals a safe and loving space. However, the shelter that these animals are currently housed in, is in a low-lying area, making it easier to get flooded during the monsoons or during a cyclone. The animals can't suffer another devastation to their home. Dr. Shiranee has started building another shelter for them, but unfortunately, she doesn't have the means to continue the construction on her own any longer.""We need help to complete the construction of this shelter and move our animals there. They've been through a lot already, they deserve to be in a safe home."" She now needs your help to feed them and give them a safe, permanent home.

2734,One Selfless Man Is Saving Thousands Of Families From Going Hungry,Hunger,https://www.donatekart.com/Hunger/Help-swabhimaan," When Venkatraman Iyer left his successful career in the middle-east to come back to India, little did he imagine that one day he would be responsible for changing hundreds and thousands of lives. Ever since he started his NGO, Swabhimaan, in 2001, Venkatraman has been working tirelessly to uplift the lives of the people in the largest slum of Bengaluru. From health, employment, education and food, he supports them in every possible way he can. However, it is in the last 7 years that Venkatraman has done his most important work - feeding them. Every person living in the slum has seen so much pain and suffering. For them, every roti and every handful of rice is precious. While people in the slums are struggling to afford even one meal a day, several buckets of excess food are being thrown away by corporate offices every single day - food that can feed hundreds of people. But instead of feeding a hungry stomach, it’s being thrown into the dustbin. Venkatraman couldn’t bear to watch this knowing that so many people were going hungry on most days. He then decided to bring the excess food from software companies and distribute it in the slum the same day. By collecting food from three corporates, Venkatraman has been able to give 1500 free meals every day. It’s been 7 years since, and people still continue to line up for food. Today, they are not just people he’s helping, they are his extended family, his community. Unfortunately, the pandemic and lockdown brought everything to a standstill. With corporate offices being closed, the food supply stopped. Venkatraman’s community was in crisis - people had lost their livelihoods and children were going hungry. He then took it upon himself to cook for 1500 people every day since the lockdown, but this is not enough. With the lack of food and groceries, Venkatraman is struggling to ensure his family doesn’t starve.“I can’t imagine being away from them. Their pain and misery is mine. When they’re happy, I’m happy. I spend a lot of time here with my family, and it’s so nice to see them be self-reliant. Among everything I do, feeding them is the closest to my heart. There are so many people here that rely on me, I can’t let them down.” - Venkatraman IyerYou can help him feed the largest slum in Bengaluru during these difficult times.

While driving in Bengaluru, Dr. Sunil witnessed a gruesome accident where the injured person was left helpless on the road. No one was willing to come forward to help. Luckily, Dr. Sunil was carrying the first aid kit with him and rushed to his rescue. He saved the man’s life, only because he was in the right place at the right time. This left Dr. Sunil deeply hurt - how many people were suffering the same plight because they didn’t get help in time or couldn’t afford it? The answer was lakhs! He wanted to help as many as he couldHe decided to quit his well-paying job at a corporate hospital and founded Matru Siri Foundation, an NGO that gives free medical care to the underprivileged.

He has treated over 1,20,000 patients and conducted over 750 free health check-up camps across the country. To thousands of people, Dr. Sunil is no less than a messiah. “I believe medical care is a fundamental human right, but still there are so many people who can’t afford even basic medical care. No one should die or suffer just because they live far away from the doctor or clinic. Since they can’t come to me, I make sure I go to them. They deserve my help.”But now the problem was two-foldTrue to his nature, Dr. Sunil only increased his efforts during the pandemic. He went from door to door for check-ups, but he soon realized another problem was affecting their health - lack of food. None of his patients have the means to feed themselves or their families anymore. They are suffering. Having lost their livelihoods, they are struggling to make ends meet.

2747,Help Sister Damien Give Hundreds Of Abandoned People A Safe Home,Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/Help-AshadhamAshram," How many times have we seen someone lying helpless on the road, without any food or water, and no home to go back to? It’s not an uncommon sight. And more often than not, we walk by, carrying on with our day. However, some people are so selfless, that they make it their mission to try and help as many people as they come across. Sister Damien is one such person. She started Asha Dham Ashram in 1997, a rescue and rehabilitation centre for the homeless and underprivileged, and has dedicated her life to serving them ever since. Most of the people she rescues suffer from a mental illness, and are given utmost love and care at Asha Dham.It was during the last days of her teaching career that Sister Damien’s life changed. She found an 85-year-old lady, Lali, lying by the road, with both legs fractured. Her wounds were decaying, and she was crying out in pain, but not a soul stopped by to help her. Sister Damien and other sisters went to her, bandaged her wounds, and took her to the hospital in an auto-rickshaw with great difficulty. Sister Damien was hopeful that Lali would be taken care of at the hospital, and then sent to a safe place. The doctors and nurses immediately tended to Lali’s wounds, and sister Damien heaved a sigh of relief. However, after a few days, she passed by the same spot in the city and spotted Lali lying on the road again. Sister Damien was devastated to see her in the same misery and pain. She and her fellow sisters arranged a bed for Lali and brought her to a rented house. Here, they personally healed Lali to perfection with medicines, love, and care; and this became Lali’s home.Sister Damien then founded Asha Dham in Udaipur. Her vision for Asha Dham is to provide a home for people like Lali who have nowhere to go and no one to take care of them. She learned Ayurvedic medicine to provide free treatment for those in need. She realized that it was almost impossible for many people to afford food or even basic medication for healing small hurts and burns.Among every other need that they take care of, food and nutrition are among the most important at Asha Dham. Many people brought here are suffering from grave illnesses, and need a good amount of nutritious food to heal them back to life.Unfortunately, Sister Damien was already struggling to bear medical and other living expenses, and now the pandemic has made affording sufficient food for the residents of Asha Dham even more difficult. Sister Damien needs your help to get groceries and medicines so that she can give the people living there a healthy and happy life.Your support will help Sister Damien feed hundreds of people at Asha Dham Ashram.

2753,Your Support Will Help Feed Lakhs Of People At Maha Kumbh Mela This Year,Faith,https://www.donatekart.com/Faith/Kumbh-Mela," The Maha Kumbh Mela is no ordinary sight. It’s the coming together of millions of people from all over the country and the world, all with the devotional purpose of cleansing their sins in the sacred river. It is incredible to watch so many people from different backgrounds gathering in peace to celebrate, pray and lend a helping hand. Held over weeks, this religious pilgrimage is the largest peaceful gathering in the world. It is celebrated four times over the course of 12 years, rotating between four pilgrimage sites on four sacred rivers. With fairs, religious discourses, anna daanam, and more, this the most sacred occasion for Hindus. However, the Maha Kumbh Mela is incomplete without the presence of Sadhus who come from all over the country to perform sacred rituals there. It is one of the only opportunities to see the reclusive Naga Sadhus before they return to the mountains. This also makes the occasion even more important. This year, the Maha Kumbh Mela in Haridwar is being held after 12 years. It started on January 14th on Makar Sankranti and will continue till April. 2020 was one of the toughest years in recent times. Lakhs of people lost their only source of livelihood, their homes, and their closest ones. Many starved and some even died of hunger. For many people, their only hope was in their spirituality and prayers. And Kumbh Mela, for a lot of them, represents hope and belief - the light at the end of the tunnel. After the devastating year that last year was, the need for anna daanam is now more than ever. Hence, the devotees of Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir will be participating in this sacred festival, representing the Brahma-Madhava Gaudiya Sampradaya on behalf of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder-acharya of the Hare Diety Movement. They will conduct their most important work of distributing full meals to all the pilgrims and visitors at Maha Kumbh Mela who have come from far off places and find respite here. They have planned an elaborate kitchen facility for this, along with a mobile kitchen. This ‘Kitchen On Wheels’ can cook hot steaming food for around 5000 people in an hour.Their immense contribution was also seen at Maha Kumbh in 2019 where they served freshly cooked meals at breakfast lunch and dinner which included, dal, vegetables, rice, and chapati among others. In the last Kumbh Mela, they were responsible for serving a total of 15,00,000 hot, nutritious meals as anna daanam. The devotees of Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir are determined to make this Maha Kumbh Mela an incredible and enriching spiritual journey for all the pilgrims that come there. With your help, they can also serve the hundreds of Sadhus who have come to grace the occasion from all over the country. Your contribution towards this cause will help Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir feed lakhs and lakhs of pilgrims and Sadhus at Kumbh Mela.

2761,Help Hare Diety Movement Save The Lives Of Thousands Of Cows In India,Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Feed-GauMatas," .We've all seen cows wandering aimlessly through the streets, some malnourished and some injured. We've seen them rummaging through the garbage for food, and sometimes even taunted by people passing by. Most of these cows have been abandoned and have nowhere to go. However, we often tend to dismiss their pain because they can't express themselves as we do. Cows are said to be among the most empathetic animals, but they're so often mistreated. Even in the holy city of Vrindavan, hundreds of cows are abandoned or injured.That's why the people at the Hare Diety Movement have pledged to take in every cow, bull, and calf that needs a home or has been abandoned and left to die. India is home to a host of indigenous breeds of cows, and each of them enjoys a special place at their gaushalas around the country - In Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and many more. In the holy city of Vrindavan, they have over 350 cows who are treated with love, respect, and care.The Hare Diety Movement has dedicated over 20 years to the care of gaushalas. They manage and control all operations themselves, ensuring the best level of care - be it feeding, nursing, or providing medical assistance. Their tireless efforts have given a new lease of life to thousands of cows. They have large teams of caretakers and experienced veterinarians to take care of the cows as well. However, the pandemic proved to be a hurdle for them. With increased prices and reduced support, they struggled to feed the thousands of cows in their gaushalas.Today, the Hare Diety Movement needs your help to feed a total of 1136 cows in 9 of their gaushalas. This includes 350 cows in Surabhi Kunj Goshala in Vrindavan, 250 in Sri Radha Diety Goshala in Bharathpur, 250 in Shree Balaram Goseva Sadan in Jaipur, 80 in Basil Woods Goshala in Mandya, 30 in Sri Diety Balaram Goshala in Mysore, 61 in Sri Radha Madhav Goshala in Ahmedabad, 60 in Goloka Dham Goshala in Hyderabad, 40 in ISKCON Sri Radha Diety Chandra Temple Goshala in Bangalore and 15 in ISKCON Sri Diety Balaram Temple Goshala in Hubli.Cows require a mix of wet and dry fodder as their food. This is commonly supplemented with special cattle feed that comprises wheat, grains, and jaggery. It can cost a gaushala many crores to provide adequate fodder to their cattle and cater to their welfare and health. With your support, the Hare Diety Movement will be able to afford fodder and can help these cows stay healthy and active. Help these voiceless animals get the love and care they deserve.

This is exactly what happened with Arun Pasare. Over a decade ago, Arun saw a security guard chase down a visibly injured dog. He caught up with the animal and deliberately dealt it a hard blow on a wound infected by maggots. The painted dog yelped pitifully and fled for its life. While he may have survived that day, Arun knew that there were plenty of dogs who suffered the same, if not worse, plights. Arun realized that while the demand for pets and pedigrees was on the rise, indifference and apathy for strays were also growing proportionately. When Arun saw a puppy get run over by a car, he decided it was time to stand up and act.Arun then started Make New Life in 2007, an NGO in Pune to care for stray dogs who have been orphaned, abandoned, or been victims of cruelty. Arun and his wife, Suvarna, started by spending the nights cooking food for the dogs and heading out early in the morning to feed them. The joy that this brought to these stray dogs was unmatched. In 2017, his dream to build a safe home for the dogs came true. He now takes in all kinds of cases - dogs who are terminally ill, paralyzed, suffering from mobility and neurological issues, and more. With over 250 dogs currently residing in the shelter, and the onus of feeding 600 dogs daily, there is a huge responsibility on Arun. Rescuing, feeding, vaccinating, and giving dogs his unconditional love takes up much of his time and resources. Even today, Arun is a permanent feature around areas like Bhosale Nagar, Chandni Chowk, Tilak Road, Padmavati, and Bavdhan in Pune. He travels to all these locations feeding over 600 dogs on any given day. He knows that there are many more longing for food.Arun’s mission is to take care of as many strays as possible. Several people have come forward to help him by contributing food, but it just isn’t enough to care for all their dogs. Arun is now struggling to feed them. While he goes out of his way to help the health and well-being of canines around Pune, he faces the challenge of getting food and first aid every day.

The two children had no one to turn to. Deepak was HIV+, extremely malnourished - all skin and bones. Due to the deficiency, his head was swollen, and he could barely move. Deepika started begging outside a mosque to try and get by, but they were struggling every day. Luckily, they were seen by a social worker.

2777,Help The Hare Diety Movement Feed Hundreds Of Starving Sadhus,Faith,https://www.donatekart.com/Faith/Help-Chardham," The Char Dham (four abodes) yatra is the most sacred of all pilgrimages for Hindus. It is believed that visiting these four Dhams - Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri - brings you salvation. With this hope and faith, lakhs of people set out on this journey every year. This is also why many among the elderly prefer to find a resting spot in one of these cities during their senior years. It is said that every Hindu should visit the Char Dhams at least once during their lifetime. One of the most important and prominent aspects of Char Dham is the Sadhus who call these holy places their home. For them, it is a way to live among sacred vibrations and divinity. But while these holy sites may be dwelling places for sadhus, they have little as a means of sustenance. Alms are the greatest source of their income and meals. They have almost no belongings, no family ties, and no savings. They live from one day to the next, depending on others’ kindness for survival. Unfortunately, the pandemic has increased their suffering. Covid has confined everyone to their homes. With no tourism to these holy sites, sadhus have no source of receiving help or managing food for themselves. Many of them have been forced to the brink of starvation. The sadhus are holy people who are of great significance to the Hindu faith. In these unanticipated times, they have no one to turn to.The Hare Diety Movement wishes to reach out to the sadhus at Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Haridwar and Rishikesh and help support them by giving them fresh meals every day. For years now, the Hare Diety Movement has fed hundreds of sadhus, widows, and homeless people around the country. They also have several gaushalas which take in abandoned and injured cows and give them a new life. Their mission is to help everyone in need.

He is reliable, a pillar of strength to families during their toughest times, and always puts others before himself. However, Karimul has seen his own share of pain. In 1995 when his mother had a heart attack, Karimul went door to door looking for help. He wasn’t able to find an ambulance or anyone to take his mother to the hospital and soon, it was too late - Karimul lost his dear mother. He was heartbroken and vowed to never let another person suffer this fate due to the lack of an ambulance. Life brought Karimul to the same crossroads a few years later. While working in the tea gardens, Karimul’s co-worker fell unconscious. He knew he could waste no time. He borrowed his manager’s bike and took his co-worker to the nearest hospital. That day, Karimul saved a life, and came up with the idea for a bike ambulance. Since then, Karimul has provided free bike ambulance services to the needy in 20 nearby villages near his village Dhalabari, Jalpaiguri, West Bengal. Some of these villages don’t have electricity, roads, or any other basic amenities. The nearest hospital is about 45 km away, and without access to an ambulance or any kind of medical care, they are left helpless. Karimul has helped over 6000 people get to hospitals in time and saved thousands of lives in the process. Now, he wants to take his service a step forward and build a free hospital for the poor. With this, he will not only be giving them an ambulance for free, but also the medical treatment they require. “To be able to save a life is so heartening. Many of these people are daily wagers, they can’t afford even basic first aid. This hospital will not only be reachable for them, but it will also give them free treatment. We will be helping so many more people with this.”Unfortunately, Karimul doesn’t have the means to continue building this community hospital. With support from people, he has constructed the ground floor of the hospital, but needs help to construct two more floors. He needs your help to complete his dream of building a free community hospital and make a difference in the lives of thousands of people who don’t have access to good healthcare. Ambulance Dada has worked towards the betterment of the people for years now. You can support his mission by helping him build this free hospital.

2792,Help Shri Shyam Rasoi Provide Nutritious Meals To The Hungry,Hunger,https://www.donatekart.com/Hunger/Help-ShyamRasoi," How many times have we noticed the old man on the broken footpath, too tired to even get up on his own or the malnourished baby sitting on her mother’s lap, crying? How many times have we stopped to think about when they had their last meal? Every day, millions of people in India struggle to get a plate of food. The pandemic has only worsened their plight. Many have been left without a job or a home. Today, they're struggling to feed themselves and their families. It’s after watching people like them suffer every day that Pravin Kumar Goyal decided to do something to help. He started Shri Shyam Rasoi a few months ago, and in this short time has managed to touch the lives of thousands. It all started when amidst the pandemic, Pravin Kumar noticed that many were going days without being able to afford food. His heart broke when he watched them pick food from the garbage. He then found his mission - to feed as many people in need as possible.“I’ve seen so many people who have starved for days because of this crisis. My goal is to make sure no one goes to bed hungry. When we started making meals we used to charge 10 rupees, but we soon realized that even that was a big amount for a lot of people. I charge the 1 rupee so that they don’t feel like they are begging for the meal, and they don’t hesitate to come here.” However, there are many who can’t even afford the 1 rupee, and Pravin Kumar welcomes them with open arms. He feeds around 1200-1500 people full meals every day in Delhi. These meals include 3-4 kinds of vegetables, rice, roti, and a sweet. For some, this is their first meal in days, but at Shyam Rasoi they make sure it won’t be their last. Supported by six staff members, Shri Shyam Rasoi provides meals at old age homes, orphanages, schools for the physically challenged, and any other place that requires it. They have even expanded to provide parcel services to neighboring areas. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, Pravin Kumar can’t get as many food materials as he used to. He now faces the challenge of continuing to feed the thousands of people that rely on him for their daily meals. Without him, they will have nowhere to go. Your support will help Pravin Kumar save the thousands of people starving in Delhi.

2793,"These Abandoned Cows Have Only Seen Cruelty, You Can Help Them Have A Better Life ",Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/Help-Hingonia-Gaushala," Many of us have a place to call home, where we can get shelter, food, and clean water. However, there are millions of animals that are wandering on the roads, with no place to call home. They have to eat from garbage piles, drink from muddy puddles, and end up getting injured in road accidents.There have been thousands of deaths across the country that involved cattle. These road accidents didn’t only take the lives of humans but have also injured voiceless creatures. Hingonia Gaushala is the world’s largest cow rehabilitation centre that’s spread across 800 acres of land. They provide a home to over 15,000 cattle. Every day, they rescue cows that are injured or abandoned on the roads. These cows are brought to the Gaushala where they can eat proper food, drink clean water, and get proper medical treatment. “There are some heart wrenching incidents where these voiceless creatures are hurt beyond damage. There was a cow that was attacked by acid. Our team of doctors worked day and night to help the cow recover.”, said Radha Priya Dasa, secretary of Sri Diety Balram Seva Trust.Hingonia Gaushala takes care of these cows like they would a little child. They have a team of 17 doctors, 30 veterinary compounders, and a team of 70-80 medical professionals who provide treatment to these injured and rescued cows. However, due to the on-going pandemic, they’re struggling to feed the cows and give them a better life. They need help to feed the cows fresh fodder that is healthy and nutritious. All these cows have experienced so much pain and cruelty already, they don’t deserve to suffer anymore. “We drink our mother’s milk for one or two years of age. However, for the rest of our life, we depend on cow’s milk.” We often hear that a cow is like our mother. Today, the Gau Mata needs your help. We urge you to contribute generously to give these injured, rescued, and innocent cows a better life by helping them have the healthy meals they need to survive. About Hingonia Gaushala - In 2016, the Government of Rajasthan and the Jaipur Nagar Nigam decided to partner with Hare Diety Movement Jaipur, which runs the Sri Sri Diety Balaram Mandir at Jagatpura, Jaipur.

2802,Join DAVO On A Remarkable Journey To Give The Elderly And Homeless A Safe Home,Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/Give-The-Homeless-A-Home," Even the smallest act of kindness can bring an enormous wave of change. It’s quite unfortunate that not many of us recognize the difference we can make in making this world a better place, unless something moves us from within. This is exactly what happened with Dev Goswami. He was born in a modest family in a village in Haryana. Like many other children at that time, Dev also worked in his school days to support his poor family. He worked hard to bring in Rs. 50-60 per month. An 18-year-old Dev was stuck at a railway station without any money or food. He hadn't eaten anything for over 2 days. Helpless Dev walked over to a stall and asked the person for a puri. Unable to fill his stomach, he reached his hand out for one more, but the vendor at the stall scolded Dev and sent him away. This experience hurt Dev to such an extent that he decided on that day that he’ll feed as many hungry people as he can. During his time as a truck driver in 1978, he was deeply disturbed by the heartwrenching sights of the homeless, hungry, elderly, and the destitute on the roads of India. Each sight reminded him of the times when he stretched his hand out for a meal and was left in the lurch. He started by feeding the helpless and the hungry on the roads. Bit by bit, he started providing them with a bath and a haircut. He stopped working as a truck driver and devoted himself to helping others. Fortunately, his wife Tara was inspired by Dev’s efforts and joined him on his remarkable journey.Dev and his wife Tara have been helping the homeless, elderly, and the destitute for the last 35 years. Since 1984, they have been working relentlessly for their welfare. They have carried out this service of helping the homeless, caring for them, and providing them food. Now, they have two homes for the homeless in Dwarka and Delhi with over 60 inmates. Of the 60 inmates, who live in a 1,800 square foot area, 20 are mentally challenged, and eight are differently-abled. They also have one in Sonipat that houses 160 inmates. While Tara takes responsibility for the Delhi home, Dev looks after the Sonipat home.With the Corona outbreak at large in the country, it’s essential for the elderly and the homeless to be able to have a healthy life and a place to stay. Dev and Tara are struggling to find a safe and secured place for these elderlies to call home. Selfless as Dev is, he has sold his own house to help these elderly and destitutes and has been able to buy land for their shelter. But they’re now struggling to get construction materials. They need your help to build a safe and secure home for those who are helpless and have been left to fend for themselves. Your support can give them a better life filled with hope and happiness.We urge you to come forward and give as much as you can. With you on their side, they can reach out and help more people find a place to call home. We urge you to come forward and give as much as you can.

2808,Celebrate The Spirit Of Ramadan By Helping Voice Of Slum Feed 500+ Slum Children,Faith,https://www.donatekart.com/Faith/Zakat-2021," Adversities come in everyone’s lives. Each person responds to it differently. While some get bogged down due to the challenges that life throws at them there are others who take them in their stride and come out in flying colours. Dev and Chandni of Voice of Slum NGO are burning examples of the latter. How it all started:Dev was all of 11 when he fled from his house to save himself from his abusive father. He lived on a railway station for several days, got arrested and was in juvenile jail for a fortnight. He could have accepted his life as a slum dweller and a ragpicker but he didn’t. He strived hard and despite many hurdles finally managed to get a job as a salesperson in a company. But he wasn’t content with what he was doing. He then met Chandni who had a similar background and was keen on doing something for the children from the slums. After the untimely death of her father, Chandni was forced to take to ragpicking and selling flowers at the traffic signals. But like Dev, she too knew that she was meant for more. Her hard work and determination paid off. She was recognized for her social work and finally she joined hands with Dev to start the Voice of Slum NGO. Every bit of your contribution matters:Voice of Slum (VoS) works towards imparting education to slum kids, training slum teenagers on vocational skills thus helping them fit in the mainstream society. One of their drives has been arranging Iftar meals to children in various slums of Delhi. This year too, they’re doing the same. They’re working with over 300 slum children who can afford nothing more than water to break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Their parents have no means to buy nutritious food that would support their day-long fast for an entire month, leave alone new clothes and slippers. You can make a lasting difference this Eid by donating food supplies, clothes and slippers for poor kids.

2809,Help G.P Bhagat Give 300+ Abandoned Senior Citizens A Healthy Life,Elderly,https://www.donatekart.com/Elderly/Help-Dr-Bhagat," After a life filled with ups and downs, trials and strife, old age comes to us and depletes us of our physical, mental, and emotional strength. We become more dependent on others and look for support. Unfortunately, support is not something too many people can afford.Several elderly men and women are abandoned by their families and are left fending for themselves. Some of them were breadwinners who have lost their ability to contribute monetarily towards the family. Dr. G.P Bhagat used to take care of any orphan he would find in the society. Soon he realized that elderly abandonment had increased in the society. They found several elderly people lying on the roads, often in mental and physical states that didn’t allow them to care for themselves. That’s when Saint Hardyal Educational and Orphan Welfare Society (SHEOWS) was born. The Guru Vishram Vridh Ashram was works to help the abandoned elderly and give them a life they deserve.“All my life I have known that elders should be treated like God. And now when I see them lying on the road with a hungry stomach and insects crawling all over them, I can’t believe my eyes. I promised myself that I will do my best to save as many of them as I could. I won’t let them suffer - not on my watch,” - Dr. G.P Bhagat, founder, SHEOWS. What began as a modest outfit that provided for a little over 10 such members now caters to the welfare of over 300 senior men and women. SHEOWS is currently running 2 old age homes, Guru Vishram Vridh Ashram of Delhi and Garhmukteshwar, since 2003 and 2008 respectively. These are the homes of 350+ old men and women found alone and abandoned. In the last 18 years, Dr. Bhagat has rescued nearly 6000 elders out of which more than 1,816 have been rehabilitated. With people of varying ages and conditions living together, there is a diverse set of needs to look after. The home provides food, clothing, and the necessary living arrangements along with provisions for special medical care, physiotherapy facilities, pathology labs, doctors and nurses, X-ray machines, and daily medication for all residents free of cost.Cases of extreme negligence are not new to the home. SHEOWS has taken in an elderly gentleman who was no longer fit enough to provide for his family and thus left to die on the road. He was found with a lost leg that was festering and filled with maggot wounds. At the home, the senior was diagnosed with rare condition and was treated free of cost.Although the goodwill from the mission ensures that every resident is cared for comfortably, the organization faces its own share of struggles. Dr. Bhagat today needs funds to help procure health supplements for all the seniors under his care.With the help of SHEOWS, these seniors have found a new purpose and hope in their life. They have found people who have similar struggles and come from similar backgrounds. They have found people who truly care and invest in their health and well-being. And they have found a place that they can call home.We can support their endeavor by helping them get necessary health supplements to make the lives of these seniors better. Let us come forward to help SHEOWS care for those who can’t care for themselves.

2812,Help Fulfil Sindhutai’s Dream Of Giving Thousands Of Orphaned Children A Better Life,Children,https://www.donatekart.com/Children/mother-of-orphans," “Back in the day, I didn’t have a roof over my head, I hadn’t eaten in days. With my newborn daughter by my side, I didn’t know where to go. I was scared of something bad happening. So, I decided to sleep at the crematorium - no one came there anyways. I made rotis out of the flour people used to leave for the dead bodies, and cooked them over the funeral pyres. That’s how I survived those days…,” - Sindhutai. Sindhutai cried her heart out that night and many more nights after that. But then this iron-willed woman decided to put her worries to the backseat and work for those who have no one to worry for them. However, this messiah of the poor and the homeless has left for the heavenly abode at 73 leaving behind a legacy of selfless service and kindness. Sindhutai Sapkal had dedicated her life to the service of all those who have faced rejection by society. She was their family and a proud parent of 1500+ children. She had 282+ sons-in-law and more than 49+ daughters-in-law. For someone who had only faced rejection in her life even from her own mother, she was showered with love - she was their beloved Maai (mother). Sindhutai always had an endearing smile adorning her face. That smile will never let you guess the amount of struggle that she had gone through since her childhood. Born on 14th November, 1948 in a cattle grazing family in the Wardha district of Maharashtra, she had a tough childhood. Her own mother never gave her the love she craved for, she even stopped her from studying beyond 4th standard. Married off at an early age to a 30-year-old man, she had an even more difficult life ahead. A victim of domestic violence, Sindhutai and her daughter were abandoned by her husband. They were forced to live on train stations, cremation grounds and even cow sheds. Life has never been smooth for her but it was now that she had a first-hand experience of those living on the streets. “I used to beg on the streets for two stale rotis, singing on the roads for a couple rupees. Sometimes, I wouldn’t even get that. But on days, when I did I used to share my food with others living on the streets. I just couldn’t eat all alone. After all, by then I was well aware of the pangs of a hungry stomach. And in exchange for the food, they would look after me and my daughter,” - Sindhutai would often share her experiences. It was during these experiences of poverty and homelessness that Sindhutai came across dozens of helpless orphans and women who were left to die a slow and painful death by the society. She started adopting these orphans and worked to feed them two square meals a day. She had nurtured over 1500+ children. Many of them are well-educated lawyers, lecturers and some, including her biological daughter, are running their own independent orphanages. One of her children has even done a Ph.D. about Sindhutai’s life. She had been honoured with more than 750 awards for her dedication and her inspiring work. But Sindhutai had used up all that money to make a home for her orphan children. Due to her relentless efforts, her children are now enjoying a life with all the necessary amenities. She was a bottomless source of energy and inspirationToday Sindhutai is gone, once again these orphans have become motherless. But we can’t let that happen. This is an appeal to all those who believe in the power of kindness and admire Mai’s work. There were times when Sindhutai struggled very hard to care for her children. The pandemic and the lockdown has made the situation worse. This is where we could all step in and help continue her legacy. She had wanted to expand the area of the current house where her children live, and for that, she had sought your help to get construction materials. This extended area will allow Sindhutai to take in more orphans and give them more facilities. While we mourn the death of this determined and strong-willed mother, let us join hands to help her organisation look after the orphans, feed them well and give them a comfortable home. She wished to give them a life they deserve. Even the smallest amount of donation counts. You can help this mother save many more lives. About the NGO:Dr. Sindhutai Sapkal (MAAI) also known as Mother of Orphans was an Indian social worker and social activist known particularly for her work for raising orphan children. She had been working for the past 45 years for the betterment of orphans.She was awarded with more than 750+ awards for her social work.

2813,Feed Hundreds Of Starving Sadhus on the occasion of Chitra Pournami,Hunger,https://www.donatekart.com/Hunger/Help-Sadhus," Corona outbreak is the largest pandemic we’ve seen since 1900. With no cure in sight and the rapid spread of this virus has made countries close their borders, drove people into self-isolation and an inevitable lockdown was put into place. The lockdown was a painful decision for many industries, companies, shops, and establishments. And, with a ban on social gatherings and crowding, the temples have been shut. Tiruvannamalai, a town in Tamil Nadu is home to the famous vast, ancient temple at the foot of the sacred Arunachala Hill. It’s an architectural wonder with intricately carved gopurams (towers) and mesmerizing details. This temple is famous for Hindu pilgrimages especially at a time called Pournami. Chitra Pournami (Chaitra Purnima), which comes once in a year, is an auspicious time and the pandemic has made it difficult for the devotees to come to the temple as it falls in the month of April this year. Pournami is the only time they would’ve gotten to eat a proper meal. Today, with a ban on gatherings and with social distancing as an important norm, they’re struggling to survive. There are hundreds of Sadhus and poor people who live at the foot of this hill. These Sadhus were dependent on the devotees, visitors and the Annadanam for food. However, with the lockdown they have been struggling to survive. Due to the fear of the pandemic, many charity organizations have stopped their work. There is an abundance of Sadhus, poor, needy,and homeless people who reside in Girivalam path, a 14km stretch that goes around the hill. Satguru Charitable Trust has been generously working towards Annadanam (feeding drive) for the past 15 years. With the support of Volunteers, they were able to provide quality food to the poor and the marginalized communities since the lockdown was announced. Their work has been extraordinary as they were able to feed over 3000 people every day. It has become a regular practice now for the Sadhus, poor and the homeless to receive food from a little Mini Van that travels the entire 14 km stretch. Just like last year, This Chitra Pournami, Satguru Charitable Trust wants to feed the Sadhus and the homeless and needy. However, with COVID-19 still at large, they’re struggling to continue their humble work of feeding them. As the country continues to fight the virus and with various restrictions being imposed, Satguru Charitable trust needs your help to give meals to the hundreds of underprivileged people and Sadhus. The Sadhus have no one else to help them and are relying on your support. With your help, they will be able to give them nutritious meals which will keep them healthy and help them get by during these difficult times. You are their only hope.

2816,"These Helpless Dogs Have Been Abused And Injured, ALAI Needs Your Support To Save Them.",Animals,https://www.donatekart.com/Animals/save-abandoned-dogs," ""The stray dogs know nothing but cruelty, neglect and pain. You will be surprised to know about the cases we come across, we have even seen cars running over dogs in front of our eyes or throwing hot boiling oil on them. They have no voice; and they can ask for neither help, freedom, nor protection. We need to be their voice and help them,” - Sajesh, Founder, ALAI Rescue. We live in a world where we, unfortunately, care for those who already have plenty, and tend to ignore the needs of those who have nothing. While there are still some who look out for and offer assistance to the humans on the streets, there is little anyone does for the four-legged kind.ALAI to the rescue Pockets in Bangalore tell a story of a different kind. In Yelahanka, the ALAI Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre is busy rushing to the aid of Pihu. Pihu had her hind leg crushed and was yelping in pain with no relief in sight. When ALAI came to her aid and took her back to their facility, they realized she had lost her foreleg too. An emergency procedure later, Pihu was treated for her leg wounds and cleared of all infestations and maggots. She is a happy survivor who is learning to cope with her 2 diagonal legs.ALAI has been the saviour to many such helpless and desolate animals. While they do their best to feed and care for as many strays as possible, they have much more work cut out for them. The heartening part of the story is that any animal taken under ALAI’s wing never returns to a homeless life. Several dogs who have lost their ability to live, love, and feel joy now wag their tail and have a spring in their step.They want to give hundreds of stray animals a life of comfortUnfortunately, not too many dogs have stories as hopeful as Pihu. While ALAI does all they can to help rescue as many street dogs, cats, and large animals as possible, the mission is far from sufficient. Given the number of strays and homeless animals we see, we need a mass movement where every member of society feels responsible.Today ALAI also struggles to make ends meet. With the number of dependents on the increase and resources consistently dwindling, ALAI needs medicines for their dogs. Almost no animal that reaches them enjoys good health. They all come with some health conditions and injuries that require medical intervention and cost ALAI heavily.What can you do to help?We may not be able to adopt or foster all the strays that need care. But we certainly can help those who have made it their mission to care for the strays. Our support and donations towards the medicines will help ALAI keep these injured strays healthy. It is time we learn to see the world as one and come forward to help unconditionally. That can start by giving ALAI a hand. About the NGO: Animal Lives Are Important (ALAI) established in May 2017 is a dog rescue and rehabilitation shelter for injured, abandoned and abused dogs located at Bagalur in Bangalore, India.The rescued dogs at ALAI all have had a terrible tale of cruelty and pain but undoubtedly are the most loved and cared for dogs in Bangalore. Receiving emergency calls round -the -clock about dogs suffering from injury, hit-and-run accidents, torture, abuse, canine distemper, differently-abled and abandoned dogs, we rescue ripped apart puppies to immobile old dogs and many more. Also known for our never give up attitude, we have always believed in giving second chances to dogs on the verge of being put down. These dogs have been nurtured to a complete recovery and evidence based care, and have time and again proved the excellent outcome and recovery at ALAI - the no kill centre.Note: All the donations towards this campaign is eligible for Indian Tax Exemption."

Some are even shunned by their own families and left to die on the road. Vijay has taken it upon himself to look after the homeless and the helpless. How it all started“Six years ago, an old, dying man changed my life. I was at a traffic signal when the old man, aged about 70, stopped and asked me to buy some chikkus. He could barely walk or speak, and with the little energy he had, he begged me to buy the fruit so that he could feed his family that day. It had been days since they had a full meal. He had begged and begged, but just couldn’t get enough money to afford even one meal. No one was helping him. At that moment, I was their only hope,” - Vijay Dobariya Vijay’s heart broke when he heard the old man’s story. He decided to buy the entire lot from him, and gave him money to take home.

Vijay has done everything in his capacity to help these senior citizensVijay started Sadbhavna Vrudhashram in Rajkot to care for the elderly by providing them with basic medicines, daily amenities and by giving them some financial support since they don’t have dependents or pensions. What started with just seven senior citizens, has now grown to a home for 300 people, of which 120 people are bedridden, have rare condition, or suffer from disabilities due to having lost their limbs, eyes, or other body parts.Since its inception, Sadhbhavna Vrudhashram has tried to allocate a small weekly allowance of Rs. 100 to each of the elder folk it houses to make them more independent. All Vijay wants is to give them a comfortable and secure life after all the pain and misery they’ve been through. “I’m saddened to see how the elderly are treated! They work to earn minuscule amounts of money just to get by in life and have no financial support or pensions. Many times, they are suffering from diseases and ailments and have no place to turn to. At Sadbhavna Vrudhashram, we aim to give our poor elderly folk shelter, help them survive, and gain back their lost financial independence.” - Vijay Dobariya.

They will be taking all the necessary precautions during this drive. Several ascetics have made Ayodhya their home.

The sadhus, aged, and seekers of peace have surrendered their lives to Ram, hoping that He will protect and care for them in this life and beyond.It is not an easy life to lead, one of renunciation. To leave yourself entirely to the ways of the divine powers requires great faith and sacrifice.
