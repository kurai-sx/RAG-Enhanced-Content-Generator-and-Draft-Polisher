Here is where you will upload your data and create you own knowledge base.
Make sure you upload each and every file for the model to successfully extract the data and send it for vectorization.

Make sure you have 3 files:
1. Banned Keywords File
2. Successful Campaigns File
3. Campaign Categories File

And also make another folder for Rules SOP where you will put all the rules of files of the model.
