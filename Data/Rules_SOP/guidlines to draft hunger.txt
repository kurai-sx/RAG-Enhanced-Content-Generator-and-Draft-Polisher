GUIDELINES FOR WRITING CROWDFUNDING STORIES FOR HUNGER CATEGORY
1. Start with a Human Face (Hook)
* Introduce a real person (child, parent, volunteer, or community member) with a name and a striking personal detail.

* Share a quote or story snippet in their voice to emotionally engage the reader.

* Use descriptive but simple language to make them feel real and relatable.

Example:
 “How can I go to school? If I don’t help my father, my sister won’t eat today,” says 10-year-old Raju as he lifts a heavy sack of coal.
________________


2. Establish the Harsh Reality (Context)
   * Describe the living conditions, hardships, or systemic issues affecting the community.

   * Use real locations, statistics, or specific hardships to ground the story.

   * Keep paragraphs short and factual, with simple emotional language.

Example:
 In Dhanbad’s coal belt, children as young as 8 carry sacks of coal instead of books. Their families survive on daily wages and face constant health hazards.
________________


3. Introduce the Changemaker/NGO
      * Highlight the individual or team driving the change—name them.

      * Share how long they’ve been working and what they’ve done so far.

      * Use one or two powerful quotes from them to build trust and emotion.

Example:
 “Feeding them is closest to my heart,” says Venkatraman Iyer, who serves 1,500 meals daily in Bengaluru’s largest slum.
________________


4. Explain the Current Crisis or Challenge
         * Describe what’s missing, broken, or endangered right now.

         * Include details of how things got worse (e.g., pandemic, lack of funding, increased need).

         * Be clear about the urgency.

Example:
 Due to the lockdown, food donations stopped. Now, Venkatraman is struggling to cook for 1,500 people daily, and groceries are running out.
________________


5. Highlight the NGO's Work and Impact
            * Mention specific programs: school, nutrition, healthcare, rescue work, etc.

            * Use numbers and examples: how many people helped, meals served, children educated.

            * Show the difference already being made, even with limited resources.

Example:
 Nand Care runs a community school and distributes meals daily. Children now dream of becoming doctors and police officers.

6. Make a Clear, Strong Call to Action (Appeal)
               * Ask the reader to donate, share, or support in simple language.

               * Specify how they can help: food kits, stationery, medical aid, money.

               * Use inclusive and hopeful language: “Together, we can…”

Example:
 Join hands with Nand Care and donate food, toys, or books. Let’s give Raju and hundreds of kids a chance at a better future.

7. Close with Emotion & Hope
                  * End on a hopeful or inspiring note—dreams, potential, or a moment of joy.

                  * Reinforce the impact the donor can make.

                  * Keep it short and sincere.

Example:
 With your help, these children can swap coal for chalk, and pain for promise.
