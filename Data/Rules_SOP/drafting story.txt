Simple guidelines to follow while drafting a crowdfunding story 
The first call with an NGO or changemaker is about building trust and gathering details. You are there to understand and help tell their story—not interrogate. Be polite, empathetic, and clear about your purpose.
How to start the call:
* Introduce yourself and the platform you represent.

* Explain why you're calling and how the story will be used.

* Reassure them that your goal is to help raise awareness and funds for their cause.

Questions to ask:
About the Cause:
   1. What is the main problem you are addressing?

   2. Who are the beneficiaries? (age, background, community, etc.)

   3. How does your project aim to help them?

   4. What has been the impact so far?

About the Story:
      5. Is there one individual or family we can focus on?

      6. What was their situation before this help?

      7. How has your intervention changed their life?

      8. What are their hopes and dreams?

About the Organization:
         9. When did you start this initiative and why?

         10. What challenges have you faced along the way?

         11. How is the organization currently funded?

         12. Why do you need funds now?

Tip: The more details and emotions you capture here, the better the story will turn out.

PART 3: WRITING THE STORY
This is where your storytelling skills come in. Once you have the inputs from the call, your job is to craft a narrative that is honest, emotional, and action-driven. 

The story will have the following major sections: 

Title
            * Make it eye-catching.

            * Include the number of beneficiaries impacted (if the number is substantial).

            * Highlight any unique points about the founder — for example, their age, a major career shift, or if they left a life abroad to work for the underprivileged in India.

            * If relevant, check with the marketing team and mention a religious festival in the title.

            * You can also use an interesting quote from the campaign as the hook for the title.

Introduction
               * Start with an engaging quote, incident, or moment that draws readers in — like a teaser to a film or web series.

               * Keep it simple and intriguing; don't give away the full story at the start.

Body
                  * Focus on the main challenge or pain point the campaign addresses.

                  * Use quotes from the founder or campaigner to bring the story to life.

                  * Flesh out the story with personal experiences, struggles, and emotions to create a connection with the reader.

Call to Action (CTA)
                     * End with a strong, clear appeal to encourage donations.

                     * Mention exactly what products or support the fundraiser is seeking, and explain how donor contributions will create real impact.

About the NGO
                        * Briefly explain where the NGO is based, how long they have been active, and their major areas of work.

                        * Keep the language simple and relatable.





How to structure the story:
                           1. Start with the Hook

                              * A powerful line or image that pulls the reader in.

                              * Example: “At just 9, Aisha walks 3km every morning—not to school, but to fetch drinking water.”

                                 2. Introduce the Characters

                                    * Talk about the individual(s) the campaign is helping. Who are they? What’s their life like?

                                       3. Describe the Problem

                                          * What challenges do they face? What’s at stake if help doesn’t arrive?

                                             4. Show the Change

                                                * How is the NGO or changemaker making a difference?

                                                   5. Make the Ask

                                                      * Clearly explain what help is needed.

                                                      * Example: “With ₹500, you can ensure a child like Aisha never misses school because of water scarcity again.”
