Campaign Updates Process
We believe in keeping our donors informed about the impact they've created. Here’s how we manage regular campaign updates:
1. Collecting Update Information
Our Business Development (BD) team adds campaigns that need updates to a shared sheet. They also include raw details such as the list of products delivered and their quantities.

2. Drafting Updates
There are two types of updates — one for the website and one for WhatsApp.

Website Update
   * Written from the Changemaker’s point of view, thanking donors for their support.

   * The update should mention the main products delivered and their quantities in a natural, easy-to-read way (avoid listicles). Other products can be mentioned casually, separated by commas.

   * The tone should be warm, heartfelt, and filled with gratitude.

   * The update is signed off by the NGO or individual changemaker.

WhatsApp Update
      * Shorter and more direct (not more than 400 characters) 

      * Written from Donatekart’s point of view in a passive voice.

      * Focus on highlighting a few key products delivered — no need to mention the full list.

      * The tone should be clear, friendly, and informative.
