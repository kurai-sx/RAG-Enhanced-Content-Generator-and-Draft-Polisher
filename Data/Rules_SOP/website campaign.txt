Note: 


For every story we work on, the following deliverables need to be shared:
1. Title

2. Long-form content – This includes the main story, body copy, and a clear call to action (CTA).

3. About the NGO – A brief section that introduces the NGO and its mission.

4. Ad copies – Short versions of the story tailored for Google and Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ads.
 
Every campaign we publish goes through a thoughtful, structured process to ensure the story is authentic, impactful, and ready to inspire action.
   1. Lead Onboarding
Our Business Development (BD) team identifies and onboards potential campaign leads.

   2. Internal Review & Validation
At the daily 3 PM call, the BD team presents the lead to our Marketing and Production teams. Together, we evaluate:

      * The campaign's fundraising potential

      * Feasibility of a photo and video shoot

      * Relatability and relevance of the story

Once the lead is approved, the campaign moves forward.
         3. Opportunity Creation
 The assigned Campaign Manager creates an opportunity in Salesforce, adding a brief along with the details of the NGO’s Single Point of Contact (SPOC).

         4. Content Development Begins
The Content Team picks up the lead from Salesforce and initiates a detailed conversation with the beneficiary, also known as the campaigner. The call focuses on:

            * Their personal story and motivations

            * Challenges and pain points

            * Defining moments that shaped their mission

            * Success stories or case studies

               5. Crafting the Story
Post-call, the Content Team creates a clear, concise narrative — sticking to a 350-word limit. Our focus is on:

                  * Using simple, everyday language

                  * A punchy introduction to draw readers in

                  * An impactful headline highlighting a striking feature (e.g. the founder’s age, career shift, unique background, or number of beneficiaries)

                  * A clear Call To Action (CTA) to encourage support 


                     * Ad copies  (refer to this sheet for adding the ad copies after every campaign content )
