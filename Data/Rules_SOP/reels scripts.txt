Guidelines for Reel Scripts  

Reel Scripts for Instagram
Objective:
 Create short, engaging reels that highlight a clear pain point and present the solution—linked to the campaign. (not more than 5-6 lines) 
Tone & Language
* Keep it simple, clear, and easy to understand

* Use conversational and relatable language

* Aim for an authentic and impact-driven tone

Structure Options
   1. Changemaker-Centric:
Focus on a personal story or quote from someone driving change. Let their journey lead into the campaign’s message.

   2. Cause-Centric:
 Start with a compelling stat or fact about the issue. Then connect it to how the campaign is solving that problem. End with a clear Call to Action (CTA).

   3. One-Line Reels:
 Use a single powerful line + CTA.
(Visuals/B-rolls can keep changing to maintain interest.)

Tips
      * Hook your audience in the first 2–3 seconds

      * Focus on one core message

      * End with a strong CTA (e.g. “Donate now”, “Join the movement”, “Share to support”)

      * Keep it within 15–30 seconds max  

      * Refer to Ads library to see what other platforms are sharing on their reels
